# OutStem Front-End Challenge:
## Pokedex Application

### I have created a Pokedex application using Typescript, Angular, HTML and CSS.

You are able to search any pokemon and will receive their name and image. This application uses the pokeapi.

The search function supports exact matches, but will also give suggested pokemons in case you misspell or partially write a pokemon name. The application uses client caching to make sure the api is not called too many times.

Hope you enjoy!
